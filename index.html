	            <td><dd> Pilósopo Tasyo, was an intelligent character in Noli me Tangere. He was described as a philosopher or a wise sage which is why "Philósopo" is in his name. He sadly lost his mother and wife so he studies philosophy to cope and distract himself from thinking about their deaths too much. Even though he was intelligent, he was a bit weird therefore making the townspeople call him a lunatic. He accepted the fact that he was one though.</dd></td>
